# A Responsive Web Page

Reference: Tom & Jerry 2021

This is a simple website that I created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The page includes a responsive navigation menu, a hero section with an image and text, and some icons that are revealed using the ScrollReveal library. There is also a button that allows the user to scroll smoothly to a section further down the page. To run the project, simply open the <b>index.html</b> file in a web browser.
