          <h2>In Theaters and HBO Max on February 26, 2021</h2>
          <p>
            One of the most beloved rivalries in history is reignited when Jerry
            moves into New York City's finest hotel on the eve of “the wedding
            of the century,” forcing the event's desperate planner to hire Tom
            to get rid of him, in director Tim Story's “Tom and Jerry.” The
            ensuing cat and mouse battle threatens to destroy her career, the
            wedding and possibly the hotel itself. But soon, an even bigger
            problem arises: a diabolically ambitious staffer conspiring against
            all three of them.
            <br />
            An eye-popping blend of classic animation and live action, Tom and
            Jerry's new adventure stakes new ground for the iconic characters
            and forces them to do the unthinkable… work together to save the
            day.
            <br />
